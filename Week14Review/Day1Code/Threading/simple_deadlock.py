"""
This module depicts a simple DEADLOCK example
Soldiers need both a sword and shield before they are considered fully equipped
In this code:
Soldier 1 takes a shared sword lock
Soldier 2 takes a shared shield lock
Soldier 1 now needs a shield lock, and soldier 2 needs a sword lock
Each soldier is holding a lock the other needs. This is a deadlock, where the program
can not continue because each thread holds onto a lock the other thread needs
