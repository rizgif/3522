"""
This module depicts a RACE CONDITION

Two threads attempt to write text into their own respective files. The goal is for
two output files to be created with their own unique text output

However due to timing issues only one output file is generated with varying text

SOLUTION:
Use locks to protect shared data from being accessed concurrently
